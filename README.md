"#Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock":

This web-game is a modified version of the popular game: "Rock-Paper-Scissors". It's a single player game, in which based on yours and your opponent's(computer) choices, you win, lose or draw the game. The scoreboard shows the number of games won by both the players (you and the computer).

Game Rules:- As explained by the Great Sheldon Cooper: "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
